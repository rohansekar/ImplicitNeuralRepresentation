This is a project on neural implicit representation of a deep network that can be used to memorize an image or even reconstruct it from non-linear measurements.

There are 5 different ways for learning an image using neural network:
1) Image regression with implicit neural representation -> train_INR.py
2) Using Fourier feature network as input -> train_fourier.py
3) Reconstruction from Radon transform -> train_radon.py
4) Nonlinear Radon transform -> train_nl_radon.py
